# Responsive NavBar

This project is a responsive NavBar created by [Victor Hugo Santos Aguiar](https://github.com/vhugoaguiar) using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

## How It Works

The NavBar includes a toggle button that reveals navigation links when clicked (on small screens). It adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience, using TailwindCSS breakpoints. The JavaScript function `toggleMenu()` dynamically changes the menu icon and controls the visibility of the navigation links, providing an interactive and user-friendly design.
